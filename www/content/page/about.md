### Chop policy
1. The Tournament prize pool will be disbursed, as set forth. It may be modified by the establishment management with the agreements of the Tournament players still involved.
2. The Tournament clock will continue to run, until the Tournament ends, with a chop or completion.
3. If it is not an ICM chop or an agreed chop. At least 20% of the remaining prize pool.
4. Process: Each player will receive 2 cards.  A black and red one. Black to agree to a supposed chop. Red to disagree.  If there is one Red card then the game continues.  Another proposal of a chop may be proposed in half an hour or later.
